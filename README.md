The purpose of this project is to showcase and practice how to use CSS to create animated border effects.

The project uses ::after and ::before pseudo-elements as containers for the border, and utilizes animation and transform properties to control the movement and transformation of the border.

The inspiration for this project comes from Kevin Powell's tutorial video, which provides a detailed explanation of the principles and implementation methods of animated border effects, as well as a practical example.

This project has made some modifications and optimizations based on the video.
